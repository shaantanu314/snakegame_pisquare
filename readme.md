# about game

Snake is the common name for a video game concept where the player maneuvers a line which grows in length, with the line itself being a primary obstacle. 
The concept originated in the 1976 arcade game Blockade, and the ease of implementing Snake has led to hundreds of versions (some of which have the word 
snake or worm in the title) for many platforms.

The player controls a dot, square, or object on a bordered plane. As it moves forward, it leaves a trail behind, resembling a moving snake. 
In some games, the end of the trail is in a fixed position, so the snake continually gets longer as it moves. In another common scheme, the snake
has a specific length, so there is a moving tail a fixed number of units away from the head. The player loses when the snake runs into the screen
border, a trail or other obstacle, or itself. 

In this game we have a snake whose length increases on eating the apple
